  # "gcb" profile allows building and pushing the images
  # on Google Container Builder without requiring docker
  # installed on the developer machine. However, note that
  # since GCB does not cache the builds, each build will
  # start from scratch and therefore take a long time.
  #
  # This is not used by default. To use it, run:
  #     skaffold run -p gcb
