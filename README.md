# Backend for the ClusterThruster project

ClusterThruster is a web application to simplify the organization of sharing cluster resources.
Users will at least be able to register and subscribe to cluster resources.
This project is built in the context of the course Scalable Systems at TU Berlin.

## Technologies

The [go](https://go.dev/) server uses the [fiber framework](https://docs.gofiber.io/) and is connected to a mongodb instance, using the [mongo driver](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo?utm_source=godoc).
Authentication/authorization is done using jwt and bcrypt.

## Get started

To just run the backend in docker use
```
docker-compose up
```
Make sure that you adapt your .env as described below

To run the server use the command
```
go run main.go
```

To compile it  run
```
go build -o ./build/server main.go
```
-o to specify output directory

To run tests execute
```
go test -v ./tests -tags test
```
-v for verbosity
./tests because that's the directory where they live
-tags test because the ability to drop the entire database is only compiled for testing

For debugging we recommend using [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve)
```
dlv debug github.com/PPSKSY-Cluster/backend
```

## Configuration and secrets

Currently, all that is located in your .env in the root directory.
Possible fields are :

| NOTIFICATION_INTERVAL | 3600                           | The interval in which the availability of wanted resources is checked (in seconds)<br/>for testing use smaller intervals |

For tests a seperate .env is needed in the corresponding folder `./tests`.

## Short note on mail
We've used the mail functionality with [gmx](https://www.gmx.net/) as a relay host, but all other relays supporting username and password based authentication should be fine.
